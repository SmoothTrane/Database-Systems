	8: Tell	me	about	check	constraints:	What	are	they?	What	are	they	good	for?	Whatâ€™s	the
advantage	of	putting	that	sort	of	thing	inside	the	database?	Make	up	some	examples
of	good	uses	of	check	constraints	and	some	examples	of	bad	uses	of	check	constraints.	
Explain	the	differences	in	your	examples	and	argue	your	case.

ANS:

Check constraints are conditional constraints that places a limit on a what can values can be splaced in an attribute. They are good for enumerating values and doing an arithmetic inequality. Check constraints places a limit on the value range of a specific column. Check constraints can also be used on a table,
which places limits on columns based on values in other columns in the row. The advantage of using a check constraint insie the database is that it clearly defines what sort of values should
placed inside of a specific column in a table. In addition, it clears up ambiiguity, which creates less room for confusion.


Good uses of check constraints:

 CREATE TABLE STUDENTS
 (
 cwid int NOT null,
 	fname varchar(255) not null,
 	lname varchar(255) not null,
 	gender char(1) check (gender in('F', 'M'))
 );



CREATE TABLE APPLICATION
(
	status varchar(255) check(status in('PENDING', 'ACCEPTED', 'DENIED'))
);



These are generally good examples of check constaints because they provide a logical limitation of what can be selected for the specific columns.
Bad use of check constraints:

CREATE TABLE Sneakers
(
brand varchar255 check (brand = "Nike")
)

This check constraint is bad because it limits a general sneakers database to be only one brand, while there can possibly be many brands of sneakers in a sneakers database.
